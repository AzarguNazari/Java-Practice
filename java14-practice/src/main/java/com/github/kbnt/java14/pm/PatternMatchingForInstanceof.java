/**
 * The <b>pattern matching for <i>instanceof</i></b>
 * (<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/305">JEP 305</a>) feature allows us
 * to test if a reference is an instance of a class and cast it in "one shot"
 * eliminating one line of boilerplate cast. <br>
 * <br>
 * This is a typical example where the impact might seem insignificant - if
 * applied at a small scale, but think about all the lines of Java code out
 * there, it keeps adding up.<br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * Without trying to compare apples to pears, let me make an electrical analogy:
 * accordingly to <a href=
 * "https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/save-electricity-and-fuel/lighting-choices-save-you-money">www.energy.gov</a>,
 * "by replacing your home's five most frequently used light fixtures or bulbs
 * with models that have earned the ENERGY STAR, you can save $45 each year.".
 * At the moment of writing this, in US (where electricity is <i>not that
 * expensive</i>) there were are around <a href=
 * "https://www.statista.com/statistics/183635/number-of-households-in-the-us/">130
 * million households</a>. With a very rough aproximation, that means savings of
 * <i>$5.8 billion</i> per year (larger than
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro">Montenegro's</a> GDP,
 * which is <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/gdp-by-country/">$4.8
 * billion</a> per year).<br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * Back from the analogy, we are 9+ million Java developers... Imagine how many
 * times during the latest 20+ years we created redundant lines of code like
 * this...<br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * Note that this might be just the beginning of similar features, like the
 * <a href= "https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8213076">pattern matching for
 * switch</a>.
